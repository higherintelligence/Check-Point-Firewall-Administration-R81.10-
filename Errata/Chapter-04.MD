# Chapter 4
Ensure you are using the latest scripts downloaded from the official repo. These have the latest fixes.

## Creating a Windows Server base VM in the GUI pp. 99-109
1. Different user interface from what is pictured when configuring the VM
    - This is due to changes in the VirtualBox UI
2. Number of CPU cores and RAM not explained in the book
    - The amount of RAM specified, 2GB is sufficient for a basic Windows server with the following notes:
      - the clone script gives 4GB RAM to SmartConsole VM
    - The book does not address how many CPU cores to assign for the Windows VMs. You can safely default to 1 core for the servers with the following notes:
      - increase the number of cores to 2 for the SmartConsole VM later
      - increase the number of cores to for ADDCDNS later (will use in chapter 11, page 432)
3. Figure 4.13 shows an incorrect Folder Path.
    - Folder path: C:\CPBook\LabShare
5. Unclear what password to use Administrator p. 106
    - You can choose any password you want for the Administrator account here. You won't need it later.
    - However, to be consistent, use the standard password `CPL@b8110` which will be used later setting  up the servers
## Windows Server base image scripted pp. 110-111
1. Page 110 step 1. says to run the command "from an elevated Command Prompt." If you fail to do this, the VM will fail to boot with Windows Setup message "Windows cannot find the Microsoft License Terms. Make sure the installation source are valid and restart the installation."
    - building using the UI does not have this problem
>>From the author: new unattended_swap.bat script contains error check with prominent message, when executed in non-elevated command prompt.
2. The book does not mention it, but you will want to install software the same as page 109 step 22. If the F: Labshare drive can't be found, reboot the VM again
    - PuTTY
    - WinSCP
    - Chrome
    - Notepad++
4. `create_WINBASE.bat` has an extraneous slash on line 20 for hostpath

Reproducing issue error message:
```
C:\CPBook\LabShare\Scripts>VBoxManage sharedfolder add WINBASE --name "Labshare" --hostpath "C:\CPBook\LabShare\" --automount --auto-mount-point F:
VBoxManage.exe: error: RTPathQueryInfo failed on shared folder path 'C:\CPBook\LabShare" --automount --auto-mount-point F:': VERR_INVALID_NAME
VBoxManage.exe: error: Details: code E_INVALIDARG (0x80070057), component SharedFolderWrap, interface ISharedFolder, callee IUnknown
```
Correct code for `create_WINBASE.bat`:
```
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
SET VM=WINBASE
REN C:\CPBook\LabShare\ISOs_and_OVAs\*SERVER_EVAL_x64FRE*.iso WINBASEEVAL.iso
VBoxManage createhd --filename %VM%.vdi --size 40960
VBoxManage createvm --name %VM% --ostype "Windows2019_64" --register
VBoxManage storagectl %VM% --name "SATA Controller" --add sata --controller IntelAHCI
VBoxManage storageattach %VM% --storagectl "SATA Controller" --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium %VM%.vdi
VBoxManage storageattach %VM% --storagectl "SATA Controller" --port 1 --device 0 --type dvddrive --medium emptydrive
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --ioapic on
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM%  --boot2 disk --boot1 dvd --boot3 none --boot4 none
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --memory 2048 --vram 128
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --nic1 intnet
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --nictype1 82540EM

VBoxManage sharedfolder add %VM% --name "Labshare" --hostpath "C:\CPBook\LabShare" --automount --auto-mount-point F:
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --clipboard-mode=bidirectional
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --draganddrop=bidirectional
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --nested-hw-virt on
VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --pae off
VBoxManage unattended install %VM% --iso=C:\CPBook\LabShare\ISOs_and_OVAs\WINBASEEVAL.iso --image-index=2 --user=Administrator --password=CPL@b8110 --install-additions
VBoxManage startvm %VM% --type gui
```
>>From the author: replaced this command with:
>>VBoxManage sharedfolder add %VM% --name "Labshare" --hostpath C:\CPBook\LabShare\ --automount --auto-mount-point F:
>>which does not cause error when executing.
## Finalizing the Windows Server base VM installation pp. 112-113
1. Step 2 powershell.exe example is has the incorrect name for the powershell script
    - the trailing double quote (") is REQUIRED
    - should be `powershell.exe -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command (F:\Scripts\sysprep_for_WINBASE.ps1)"`
    - the batch file `WINBASE_sysprep.bat` calls the powershell script correctly
>>You are correct- this omission is in the book example only.
2. Step 3 provided code uses two storage driver that are not defined, "Floppy" and "SATA Controller"
    - Initial testing had the VM mostly working when ignoring this error
    - Created a corrected script and works well. Creates the Floppy storage and uses the correct storage name.
3. Step also references `eject_and_snapshot_WINBASE.bat`. This script needs to be corrected as well IF you manually set up base base image using the UI. The script needs to be AS IS if you built with `create_WINBASE.bat`.
```
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox
SET VM=WINBASE
VBoxManage storagectl %VM% --name "Floppy" --add floppy
VBoxManage storageattach %VM% --storagectl Floppy --port 0 --device 0 --medium emptydrive
VBoxManage storageattach %VM% --storagectl "SATA" --port 1 --device 0 --medium emptydrive
VBoxManage storageattach %VM% --storagectl "SATA" --port 2 --device 0 --medium emptydrive
VBoxManage snapshot %VM% take "Snapshot 1" --description "Do NOT delete!!! This snapshot is used to spawn the linked clones of all Windows components in the lab."
```

Need to double check this version works with both manual GUI and scripted builds.
>> From the author: Please check- original script, even when executing with errors, were able to eject all the media mounted in the VMs. In your script, you are modifying VM by adding storage controller only to attempt the floppy ejection.
## Creating a Check Point base VM pp. 113-123
1. Inconsistent naming of the Check Point base VM causes problems
    - Page 114 instructs to name it `CPBASE` and shows this in the screenshot
    - Page 117 shows a different name `CPBASE1`
    - The official code respository script  `eject_and_snapshot_CPBASE.bat` has the corrected code
>>From the author: My bad- needed additional screenshots and code snippets and ended-up using altered VM name to reproduce the action. 
2. Number of CPU cores and RAM explained
     - 2 cores minimum, 4 cores is recommended for CPSMS
     - sk104848 recommends at least 6GB memory for the SMS; 8GB for production
     - The updated repo now provisions 6GB RAM for CPSMS
 >>From the author: cloneVMs now assigning apropriate number of vCPUs and RAM to all components.
3. Book was written with AMD processors in mind, not Intel processors
    - Page 118 instructs checking `VT-x/AMD-V`, which is not available on systems using Intel CPUs
 >>This statement is partially incorrect: The labs were modeled on both, Intel and AMD CPUs. VT-x is native Intel technology. The only difference in how AMD vs Intel is treated is in paravirtualization settings of CPBSASE VM and its clones. Fore these VMs running on AMD, paravirtualization is set to "None", whereas for same VMs runing on Intel, it is set to "Default". 
4. Page 121 figure 4.33 has a small error in the screenshot; the mounted ISO file from the previous page is not shown
## Check Point base image scripted pp. 123-124
1. The book script on page 123 has a typo for size: 61,440 should be 61440
2. The report script `create_CPBASE.bat` has the wrong disk size. Instead of 40960 it should be 61440.
3. Didn't see steps to disable audio or USB controller in the script
    - `VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --usb off`
    - `VBoxManage modifyvm %VM% --audio none`
    - Added to this repo; will watch for it to be added to official repo
## Preparing cloned Windows hosts pp.134-138
1. The book has the correct LeftHost.ps1 commands. The repo script has been updated with the correct commands.
The following is the correct script from the book, reformatted to match the other scripts:
```
#Caution!!! This script disables the Windows Update Services.
#It is intended for the use in isolated lab environments for space saving purposes only.
#If you do not have space constraints, comment-out five lines before the last one and save the script!!! 
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName ServerManager | Disable-ScheduledTask -Verbose
Rename-Computer -NewName LeftHost
New-NetIPAddress -IPAddress 10.10.10.10 -DefaultGateway 10.10.10.1 -PrefixLength 24 -InterfaceIndex (Get-NetAdapter).InterfaceIndex
$WindowsUpdate = "Scheduled Start"
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName $WindowsUpdate | Disable-ScheduledTask  -Verbose
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName StartComponentCleanUp | Disable-ScheduledTask  -Verbose
Set-Service wuauserv -Startup Disabled
Stop-Service wuauserv -Force
Restart-Computer
```
2. Missing DNS settings on these Windows hosts with static IP addresses
    - LeftHost, SmartConsole, DMZSRV do not have DNS configured
    - The official repo has been updated to set DNS
    - RightHost is set with DNS server 9.9.9.9
Run the following powershell command on each server (addcdns commmands already included this)
```
Set-DNSClientServerAddress -InterfaceIndex (Get-NetAdapter).InterfaceIndex -ServerAddresses 10.20.20.10
```
>>From the author: Repo scripts were updated with DNS config line.
## Preparing Active Directory and the domain controller pp.139-143
1. Consider increasing vPCU and RAM on the ADDCDNS VM
2. Page 139 step 7 has code that was later added to the Github repository.
    - The following are the two files that can be created and added to the Scripts folder
        - `addcdns.bat`
        - `addcdns.ps1`
    - Don't forget to rename the system to ADDCDNS and reboot before runnning the script
 >>From the author: There are now two pairs of scripts for ADDCDNS host- addcdns_step1 and addcdns_step2. the first one renames and reboots the server, second one, perfoms the AD deployment and reboots server again to complete AD setup.
## Preparing cloned Check Point hosts pp. 143-145
1. The updated repo script now increases CPSMS RAM to 6GB
    - sk104848 recommends at least 6GB memory for the SMS; 8GB for production
## Preparing SmartConsole pp. 145-146
1. Consider adding vCPUs to SmartConsole VM
>> From the author: No need. It works fine with 2 vCPUs
3. Typo in step 4; the IP address of CPCM1 should be `10.0.0.2`
>>You are correct.
